    @siddhesh with team members manually recorded videos of various exercises like Deadlift, Bicep Curl, Pushups and Squats, passed data through mediapipe's pose landmarker model and extracted body landmarks in 3d space. Then trained a machine learning model using the extracted body landmarks to predict the body position during exercise.
